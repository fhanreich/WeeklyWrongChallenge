Given two sequences x and y, calculate the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) of x and y, i. e. the minimum number of edits needed to transform x into y. The allowed edits are:

- insert a single item
- delete a single item
- replace a single item with another item
