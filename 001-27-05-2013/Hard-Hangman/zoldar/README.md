# hangman

Simplistic hangman implementation by Adrian Gruntkowski

## Usage

lein run [word]

I know that it doesn't make much sense - that's rather for the purpose of example. Maybe I'll change it to a more final solution. For now I just wanted to see if it's possible to hide user input behind stream (lazy sequence) abstraction and treat the state changes in game as a sequence as well.
