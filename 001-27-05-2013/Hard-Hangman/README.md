# Hangman

Your task, should you choose to attempt it, is to build a command line [Hangman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29) game.

This will be a *TWO* week task. This means that public code review will be planned for the hangout in the second week of June.

Feel free to pair, discuss on the ML or anything else really; let's see how different the implementations are!
