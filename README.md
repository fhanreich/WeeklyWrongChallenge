# WeeklyWrongChallenge


The weekly challenge repo for WPW.


# Directions

Each week has a directory containing an easy problem, and a hard problem.

Create a file named <yourhandlehere>.clj with your solution(s) in each problem directory(if you want to solve that problem)

Feel free to open up PRs, issues, etc in order to discuss the different implementations.
